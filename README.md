# Hello Repositories!

Hello, I am [Shon](https://bit.ly/m/shon) and this is my base GitHub page.  I am a UiPath RPA developer.  There are many training supplements and projects in this repository in both C# and VB.NET.

> [!NOTE]
> Since I develop many UiPath projects in both C# and VB.NET, I started to use Hungarian Notation for the VB projects and standard Microsoft recommendations for C#.  It helps me differentiate projects and reduces the number of errors in the .xaml from activity cross pollination as I often have many IDE's open at once.
