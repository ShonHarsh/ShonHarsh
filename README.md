# Hello Repositories!

Hello, I am [Shon](https://bit.ly/m/shon) and this is my base GitHub page.  I am a UiPath RPA developer.  There are many training supplements and projects in this repository in both C# and VB.NET.

> [!TIP]
> I am quite busy currently.  Some of the avenues of my attention are:
> - Rewriting and updating the RPA Developer Foundation practice projects in C# and VB.Net.
> - Completing a course on LINQ.
> - Building UiPath Academy - Automation Explorer & Automation Developer Associate practice projects.
> - Completing notes for Automation Developer Professional training and projects.
> - Giving my GitHub projects a review; specifically the README.md files.
> - Learning Google Tag Manager for a side hustle.
> - Revisiting C# and Python.
> - Introduction to Blue Prism and Automation Anywhere.

> [!NOTE]
> Since I develop many UiPath projects in both C# and VB.NET, I started to use Hungarian Notation for the VB projects and standard Microsoft recommendations for C#.  It helps me differentiate projects and reduces the number of errors in the .xaml from activity cross pollination as I often have many IDE's open at once.
